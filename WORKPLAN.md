The **College School System** is a centralized platform designed to manage academic and administrative operations for a college. It includes modules for managing departments, students, instructors, courses, enrollments, prerequisites, classrooms, schedules, and student units. The system is built using **Next.js** for the frontend, **ASP.NET Core** for the backend, and a **SQL Database** (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) for data storage.

### **2. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/college-school-system.git
cd college-school-system
```

---

### **3. Frontend Setup (Next.js)**
1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` folder and add the following environment variables:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```
4. Run the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### **4. Backend Setup (ASP.NET Core)**
1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Update the `appsettings.json` file with your database connection string:
   ```json
   "ConnectionStrings": {
     "DefaultConnection": "Server=your-server;Database=your-database;User Id=your-user;Password=your-password;"
   }
   ```
3. Run the backend:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

### **5. Database Setup**
1. Create a new database in your SQL server (e.g., `CollegeSchoolSystem`).
2. Apply migrations to create the database schema:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

---

### **6. Running the Application**
1. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   dotnet run
   ```
2. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
