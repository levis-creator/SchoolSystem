Based on the provided **Database Schema**, I will refine and expand the documentation to include a detailed **Database Design** section, along with additional context and explanations. Here's the updated documentation:

## **College School System Documentation**

### **1. Introduction**

The **College School System** is a comprehensive platform designed to manage academic and administrative operations for a college. It includes modules for managing departments, students, instructors, courses, enrollments, prerequisites, classrooms, schedules, and student units. The system ensures data integrity, scalability, and ease of use for all stakeholders.

## **2. Database Design**

The database is designed using a **relational model** with normalized tables to minimize redundancy and ensure data integrity. Below is the detailed schema, including tables, columns, relationships, and constraints.
